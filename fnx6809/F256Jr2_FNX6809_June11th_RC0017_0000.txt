The Cyber Mistress â€” 9:52 PM

Okay, wonderful Nitros-9 People, this is a new version that covers your Wishlist, so it is a big one. Refer to the google document for reference.

It has not been tested, so when you manage to get the text going please go through your usual tests to confirm that the foundation portion is good to go!

Now, the only thing I changed in your Request is the fact the the look up table will be @ $5300 and $5340 as opposed to $52C0 and $5300 respectively. <<< SO be aware.

You also have now full access to write back the onboard flash if you so desire.

Also, just to make sure everybody is on the same page, the WIFI high-speed is now 921600 instead of 2Mbits, you should not loose data anymore when you read the FIFO.
